# thumbnail-stable-diffusion

I fine tuned stable diffusion on youtube thumbnails and the video title. I was hoping to create a tool that help Youtubers brain storm with diffusion models to create eye-catchy thumbnails. The results for kids channels and cartoonish thumbnails were particulary cool. However, I found that stable diffusion had a hard time generating photo-realistic thumbnails.



Here are some of the generated thumbnails with the fine tuned model. First row of all the figures are the generated images by stable diffusion (not fine-tuned) for the video title. Rest of the rows are outputs of the fine tuned model on the data of the channel:
